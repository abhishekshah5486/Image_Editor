## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Java Image Editor:

### Prerequisites

- Java Installed on the device
- Any Java IDE.
- An Image.
### Libraries Needed:-
  - java.awt.Color;
  - java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
  - java.io.File;
  - java.io.IOException;
  - java.util.*;
  - javax.imageio.ImageIO;

    
# All the Functions Explanations:-

1) GRAY SCALING :

- The method first retrieves the height and width of the input image to determine its dimensions.
- It creates a new BufferedImage, grayImage, with the same dimensions as the input image, but of type BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_GRAY, which represents a grayscale image.
- It iterates over each pixel in the input image using nested loops. For each pixel, it retrieves the RGB value (color) and sets the corresponding pixel in the grayImage to the same value. This process effectively converts each color pixel to its grayscale equivalent.
- After processing all pixels, the method returns the grayImage, which now contains the input image converted to grayscale.
   
2) ROTATE ANTICLOCKWISE :

- The method first retrieves the height and width of the input image to determine its dimensions.
- It creates a new BufferedImage, outputImage, with swapped width and height compared to the input image, effectively creating a new image with rotated dimensions.
- It iterates over each pixel in the input image using nested loops. For each pixel, it retrieves the RGB value (color) from the input image and sets it in the outputImage with the row and column positions swapped. This swapping of rows and columns results in the image being rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise.
- After processing all pixels, the method returns the outputImage, which now contains the input image rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise.   

3) ROTATE CLOCKWISE :
- The method first retrieves the height and width of the input image to determine its dimensions.
- It creates a new BufferedImage, outputImage, with swapped width and height compared to the input image, effectively creating a new image with rotated dimensions.
- It iterates over each pixel in the input image using nested loops. For each pixel, it retrieves the RGB value (color) from the input image and sets it in the outputImage with the row and column positions swapped. This swapping of rows and columns results in the image being rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- After processing all pixels, the method proceeds with an additional step to complete the clockwise rotation:
   1) It calculates the new dimensions of the outputImage (swapped width and height).
   2) It iterates through half of the newWidth (the width of the rotated image divided by 2 and the full newHeight.
   3) For each pixel, it performs a swap operation between the left and right halves of the image columns, effectively rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise.
- After processing all pixels, the method returns the outputImage, which now contains the input image rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

5) VERTICAL INVERSION : This Java method, invertImageVertically, flips the input image vertically along its horizontal axis. It iterates through half of the image's height and swaps pixel values between the top and bottom halves to achieve vertical inversion. The result is returned as outputImage.

6) HORIZONTAL INVERSION : Here I First get the height and width of the image which i need to edit. Then I created a new bufferred Image in which I append the new changes. Then I used a nested for loop for getting the particular pixel values of the image, then i set the values according to the need in the new bufferred image. This runs and successfully creates a result image in the current working directory with name HorizontallyrotatedImage.jpg.

7) CHANGE BRIGHTNESS : Here I First get the height and width of the image which i need to edit. Then I created a new bufferred Image in which I append the new changes. Then I asked the user to enter the percent of brightness to increase between 1 to 100. After which I increased the red, green and blue pixel values by that much percent and if it exceeds 255 then i set it to 255 and similarly if it decreases from 0 then i set i to 0.This runs and successfully creates a result image in the current working directory with name changebright.jpg.



# Usage
- Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

- Run the ImageEditor.java file.
- You will be presented with a menu of options:
- Convert to Grayscale: Converts the image to grayscale and saves it.
- Rotate: Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise and saves it.
- Horizontal Invert: Flips the image horizontally and saves it.
- Vertical Invert: Flips the image vertically and saves it.
- Adjust Brightness: Adjusts the image brightness and saves it.
- Exit: Quits the image editor.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired operation on your image.
- After selecting the option the result image would be saved in the current working directory.

# CODE EXPLANATION :

This Java program, ImageEditor1, is a simple image processing tool that allows you to perform various operations on an input image. It provides the following image manipulation functionalities:

1) Convert to Grayscale: Converts the input image to grayscale.
2) Rotate Image Anticlockwise: Rotates the input image by 90 degrees anticlockwise.
3) Rotate Image Clockwise: Rotates the input image by 90 degrees clockwise.
4) Change Brightness: Increases or decreases the brightness of the image based on user input.
5) Invert Image Vertically: Vertically inverts (flips) the input image.
6) Invert Image Horizontally: Horizontally inverts (mirrors) the input image.
7) Apply Pixelated Blur: Applies a pixelated blur effect to the image based on a specified blur size matrix.

# HOW TO USE ? 
Run the program and provide the path to the input image file.

Choose one of the following operations by entering the corresponding number:

1) Convert to Grayscale
2) Rotate Image Anticlockwise
3) Rotate Image Clockwise
4) Change Brightness
5) Invert Image Vertically
6) Invert Image Horizontally
7) Apply Pixelated Blur
- Depending on your choice, you may need to provide additional information such as the brightness change percentage or blur size matrix.

- Enter the name for the output image file (e.g., "output.jpg").

- The program will perform the selected operation on the input image and save the resulting image as the specified output file.
